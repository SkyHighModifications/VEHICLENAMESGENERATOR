# Vehicle Names Generator

The Vehicle Names Generator is a tool developed by SkyHigh Modifications to simplify the process of generating Lua code for adding custom vehicle names to GTA V/FiveM servers. Let's explore its purpose, usage, and features:

## Key Features:
- **Input Flexibility:** Users can input spawn codes and real display names for multiple vehicles, allowing for customization.
- **Dynamic Output:** The tool dynamically generates Lua code based on the user's input, automating the process of adding vehicle names to the game.
- **Downloadable Output:** After generating the Lua code, users can download the output file for easy integration into their FiveM server setups.

## Usage:
- Users input spawn codes and real display names for each vehicle they want to add.
- They can add or delete vehicle inputs as needed.
- After inputting all necessary information, users click the "Generate LUA" button.
- The tool then compiles the provided information into a Lua script that adds the specified vehicle names to the game.
- Users can then download the generated Lua script for use in their FiveM server configurations.

## Purpose:
- In FiveM servers, developers often need to add custom vehicle names to enhance the gaming experience.
- The Vehicle Names Generator automates this process, saving developers time and effort by generating the necessary Lua code.
